    "### Trig Polynomials\n",
    "Trigonometric polynomials are functions of the form $f(x)=\\sum_{n=-N}^N a_ne^{inx}$. We can think of these as functions on the interval $[0,2\\pi]$, since they are $2\\pi$-periodic. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ of all these functions has a natural inner product:\n",
    "$$\\langle f, g\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi} f(x)g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x.$$\n",

    "2. Write a function to compute the inner product of two trigonometric polynomials (i.e. takes two inputs of the struct you defined in part (1))."

We are given Euler's method (which solves $x' = f(x,t)$ given $x(0)=x_0$ using a time step $h$ that is determined by the algorithm). You may assume that Euler's method gives results accurate to $\\pm 0.0001$.\n",
