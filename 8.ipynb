A common way to find fixed points is to simply iterate until two successive point are close to each other. In particular, we can pick $z_0=x_n$ and define $z_{n+1} = F(z_n)$. We can say we have found $z^*$ when $|z_{n+1}-z_n|\\leq \\texttt{tol}$. It turns out this strategy is guaranteed to work for sufficiently small $h$. Implement the function that implements this method for solving a (nonlinear) equation."
