I will not be releasing solutions (except for one video-solution) because I truly don't believe solutions are helpful. You all have the tools and smarts to solve these problems; seeing the solution is a shortcut and inhibits learning.\n",

Nonetheless, I think this is useful practice. It will really force you to think about what you are coding before you code it."

    "## Bayesian Optimization (Project-like)\n",
    "[Bayesian optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization#:~:text=Bayesian%20optimization%20is%20a%20sequential,expensive%2Dto%2Devaluate%20functions.) is a common strategy to optimize expensive-to-evaluate functions. For example, one may want to find the ratio of 5 compounds that has maximal tensile strength. In this case, each function evaluation (what is the tensile strength of the material made with this ratio?) is very expensive to evaluate: it requires creating the material with the new ratio, and putting it through a variety of physical experiments to determine the tensile strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will implement Bayesian optimization following [Peter Frazier's tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811). This entire workbook follows materials due to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist of Bayesian optimization is that given some data, we can define a probability distribution for what the true function is. In other words, given some data $D=\\{(x_1, y_1=f(x_1)),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n=f(x_n))\\}$, we should be able to compute the mean/expected value and a 95% confidence interval of $f(x)$ for any input $x$. Thus, we will need to define a function that takes in existing data and a new input $x$ and spits out the mean and variance of $f(x)$.\n",
