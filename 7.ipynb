    "We can define subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that pass through the origin in two ways:\n",
    "1. By a basis/set of spanning vectors (there should be $m$ such vectors for an $m$-dimensional subspace).\n",
    "2. By a set of equations of the form $0=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_ix_i$ (there should be $n-m$ such equations for an $m$-dimensional subspace).\n",

    "First, work in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Code two functions that convert the description of a plane between (1) and (2). Do the same for lines. \n",

    "Second, given two planes passing through the origin, find the vector description of the line in the intersection of the two planes (or, if both planes are the same, throw an error saying that the planes are identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, generalize your code to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and such that it can find the dimension of subspace and give the vector description of the subspace in the intersection between any collection of other subspaces.\n",

    "2. Find two lines that split your point cloud into quarters.\n",
    "3. Generalize. Given a point cloud in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and a description of an ($n-1$ dimensional) hyperplane (i.e. the coefficients $a_i$ from (2) in the \"Intersections of linear spaces\" problem), find the hyperplane (that doesn't necessarily pass through the origin) that splits the point cloud in half.\n",
